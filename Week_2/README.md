This repository contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate level Python exercises from my programming course. Each script is designed to practice core programming concepts including:

✅ User input and validation
📐 Unit conversions (e.g., weight, currency)
💰 Conditional logic for pricing and discounts
❤️ Health and fitness calculations (e.g., heart rate zones)
🔐 Password strength checking

These exercises help reinforce foundational skills in Python such as control flow, functions, and string handling.
